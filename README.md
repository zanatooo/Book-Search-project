# Book Search.
This application:
-provides a quick and easy way to search for books and general references according to the user’s choices.
-helps the user find the information they are looking for online by using keywords and/or phrases. Also, the user will be able to utilize two separate APIs.
-returns results quickly by scanning the Internet continuously and indexing every page it finds.
-allows the user to search for books and general references of their choice using  Google Books and Wikipedia’s API.
-these APIs work by crawling billions of pages using their own web crawlers (Bot that is typically operated by search engines). They navigate the web by downloading web pages and following links on these pages to discover new content that has been made available. (edited)
